OpenGL_Sierpinski_Mountain
========================

A 3D artificial mountain created using a form of the Sierpinski Gasket; written in C++ and rendered using OpenGL.

In Linux, simply type "make" and the program should compile, execute, and clean up after itself.
Use A, D, W, S, Q, and E to rotate the mountain.

The mountain is different every time, but here's an example of what it looks like: http://www.jessevictors.com/files/permalink/Sierpinski_Mountain.png
